Private Variables
-----------------

Cookiecutter allows the definition private variables - those the user will not be required to fill in - by prepending an underscore to the variable name. These can either be not rendered, by using a prepending underscore, or rendered, prepending a double underscore. For example, the ``cookiecutter.json``::

    {
        "project_name": "Really cool project",
        "_not_rendered": "{{ cookiecutter.project_name|lower }}",
        "__rendered": "{{ cookiecutter.project_name|lower }}"
    }

Will be rendered as::

    {
        "project_name": "Really cool project",
        "_not_rendered": "{{ cookiecutter.project_name|lower }}",
        "__rendered": "really cool project"
    }

The user will only be asked for ``project_name``.

Non-rendered private variables can be used for defining constants. An example of where you may wish to use private **rendered** variables is creating a Python package repository and want to enforce naming consistency. To ensure the repository and package name are based on the project name, you could create a ``cookiecutter.json`` such as::

    {
        "project_name": "Project Name",
        "__project_slug": "{{ cookiecutter.project_name|lower|replace(' ', '-') }}",
        "__package_name": "{{ cookiecutter.project_name|lower|replace(' ', '_') }}",
    }

Which could create a structure like this::

    project-name
    ├── Makefile
    ├── README.md
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── src
        ├── project_name
        │   └── __init__.py
        ├── setup.py
        └── tests
            └── __init__.py

The ``README.md`` can then have a plain English project title.
