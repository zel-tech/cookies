Using Pre/Post-Generate Hooks
-----------------------------

You can have Python or Shell scripts that run before and/or after your project
is generated. 

Put them in `hooks/` like this::

    cookiecutter-something/
    ├── {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/
    ├── hooks
    │   ├── pre_gen_project.py
    │   └── post_gen_project.py
    └── cookiecutter.json

Shell scripts work similarly::

    cookiecutter-something/
    ├── {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/
    ├── hooks
    │   ├── pre_gen_project.sh
    │   └── post_gen_project.sh
    └── cookiecutter.json

It shouldn't be too hard to extend Cookiecutter to work with other types of
scripts too. Pull requests are welcome.

Calling Cookiecutter Functions From Python
------------------------------------------

You can use Cookiecutter from Python::

    from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter
    
    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
    cookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')

    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
    cookiecutter('https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git')

This is useful if, for example, you're writing a web framework and need to
provide developers with a tool similar to `django-admin.py startproject` or
`npm init`.

See the :ref:`API Reference` for more details.
