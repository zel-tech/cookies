# command to install dependencies, e.g. pip install -r requirements.txt --use-mirrors
# Note: we only use coveralls with Travis, not tox. pip install coveralls doesn't work on Windows.
# This setup makes it possible for:
# 1. the tests to be run with tox on Windows
# 2. Windows users to use the requirements files without running into installation problems.
