Features
--------

Did someone say features?

* Cross-platform: Windows, Mac, and Linux are officially supported.

* Works with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and PyPy. *(But you don't have to know/write Python
  code to use Cookiecutter.)*

* Project templates can be in any programming language or markup format:
  Python, JavaScript, Ruby, CoffeeScript, RST, Markdown, CSS, HTML, you name
  it. You can use multiple languages in the same project template.

* Simple command line usage:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
        # You'll be prompted to enter values.
        # Then it'll create your Python package in the current working directory,
        # based on those values.
        $ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git

* Can also use it at the command line with a local template:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Create project in the current working directory, from the local
        # cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
        $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/

* Or use it from Python:

    .. code-block:: python

        from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter

        # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
        cookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')

        # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
        cookiecutter('https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git')

* Directory names and filenames can be templated. For example::

    {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}.py

* Supports unlimited levels of directory nesting.

* 100% of templating is done with Jinja2. This includes file and directory names.

* Simply define your template variables in a `cookiecutter.json` file. For example:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "full_name": "Audrey Roy",
            "email": "audreyr@gmail.com",
            "project_name": "Complexity",
            "repo_name": "complexity",
            "project_short_description": "Refreshingly simple static site generator.",
            "release_date": "2013-07-10",
            "year": "2013",
            "version": "0.1.1"
        }

* Unless you suppress it with `--no-input`, you are prompted for input:

  - Prompts are the keys in `cookiecutter.json`.
  - Default responses are the values in `cookiecutter.json`.
  - Prompts are shown in order.

* Cross-platform support for `~/.cookiecutterrc` files:

    .. code-block:: guess

        default_context:
            full_name: "Audrey Roy"
            email: "audreyr@gmail.com"
            github_username: "audreyr"
        cookiecutters_dir: "~/.cookiecutters/"

* Cookiecutters (cloned Cookiecutter project templates) are put into
  `~/.cookiecutters/` by default, or cookiecutters_dir if specified.

* You can use local cookiecutters, or remote cookiecutters directly from Git
  repos or from Mercurial repos on Bitbucket.

* Default context: specify key/value pairs that you want used as defaults
  whenever you generate a project

* Pre- and post-generate hooks: Python or shell scripts to run before or after
  generating a project.

* Paths to local projects can be specified as absolute or relative.

* Projects are always generated to your current directory.

  it's just "I can't get it to work on this cookiecutter" with a link to your
  cookiecutter. Don't worry about naming/pinpointing the issue properly.
* Ask for help in #cookiecutter if you must (but please try one of the other
  options first, so that others can benefit from the discussion)

Development on Cookiecutter is community-driven:

* Huge thanks to all the `contributors`_ who have pitched in to help make
  Cookiecutter an even better tool.
* Everyone is invited to contribute. Read the `contributing instructions`_,
