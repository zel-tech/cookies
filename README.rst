=============
Cookiecutter
=============

A command-line utility that creates projects from project templates. Renders a
directory of Jinja2 templates to files.

Similar projects:

* Diecutter: an API service that will give you back a configuration file from
  a template and variables. https://github.com/novagile/diecutter

  The similarity in name/functionality is a total coincidence that happened
  independently (subconsciously!). They presented a fantastic poster at 
  EuroPython 2013 :)
  
  Cookiecutter appears to be mostly compatible with Diecutter; I plan to look
  into this more and see if I can make them work together.
  
* Paste has a create option that creates a skeleton project:

* Django's `startproject` and `startapp` commands can take in a `--template`
  option: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-startproject
