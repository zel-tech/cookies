History
-------

0.6.0 (2013-08-08)
++++++++++++++++++

* Config is now in a single `cookiecutter.json` instead of in `json/`.
* When you create a project from a git repo template, Cookiecutter prompts
  you to enter custom values for the fields defined in `cookiecutter.json`.

0.5 (2013-07-28)
++++++++++++++++

* Friendlier, more simplified command line usage::

    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
    $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/
    
    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git

* Can now use Cookiecutter from Python as a package::

    from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter
    
    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
    cookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')

    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
    cookiecutter('https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git')

* Internal refactor to remove any code that changes the working directory.

0.4 (2013-07-22)
++++++++++++++++

* Only takes in one argument now: the input directory. The output directory
  is generated by rendering the name of the input directory.
* Output directory cannot be the same as input directory.

0.3 (2013-07-17)
++++++++++++++++

* Takes in command line args for the input and output directories.

0.2.1 (2013-07-17)

* Directory names and filenames can be templated.
