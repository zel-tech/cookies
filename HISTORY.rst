0.7.0 (2013-11-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a release with significant improvements and changes. Please read
through this list before you upgrade.

New features:

* Support for --checkout argument, thanks to `@foobacca`_.
* Support for pre-generate and post-generate hooks, thanks to `@raphigaziano`_.
  Hooks are Python or shell scripts that run before and/or after your project
  is generated.
* Support for absolute paths to cookiecutters, thanks to `@krallin`_.
* Support for Mercurial version control system, thanks to `@pokoli`_.
* When a cookiecutter contains invalid Jinja2 syntax, you get a better message
  that shows the location of the TemplateSyntaxError. Thanks to `@benjixx`_.
* Can now prompt the user to enter values during generation from a local
  cookiecutter, thanks to `@ThomasChiroux`_. This is now always the default
  behavior. Prompts can also be supressed with `--no-input`.
* Your cloned cookiecutters are stored by default in your `~/.cookiecutters/`
  directory (or Windows equivalent). The location is configurable. (This is a
  major change from the pre-0.7.0 behavior, where cloned cookiecutters were
  deleted at the end of project generation.) Thanks `@raphigaziano`_.
* User config in a `~/.cookiecutterrc` file, thanks to `@raphigaziano`_.
  Configurable settings are `cookiecutters_dir` and `default_context`.
* File permissions are now preserved during project generation, thanks to
  `@benjixx`_.

Bug fixes:

* Unicode issues with prompts and answers are fixed, thanks to `@s-m-i-t-a`_.
* The test suite now runs on Windows, which was a major effort. Thanks to 
  `@pydanny`_, who collaborated on this with me.

Other changes:

* Quite a bit of refactoring and API changes.
* Lots of documentation improvements. Thanks `@sloria`_, `@alex`_, `@pydanny`_,
  `@freakboy3742`_, `@es128`_, `@rolo`_.
* Better naming and organization of test suite.
* A `CookiecutterCleanSystemTestCase` to use for unit tests affected by the
  user's config and cookiecutters directory.
* Improvements to the project's Makefile.
* Improvements to tests. Thanks `@gperetin`_, `@s-m-i-t-a`_.
* Removal of `subprocess32` dependency. Now using non-context manager version
  of `subprocess.Popen` for Python 2 compatibility.
* Removal of cookiecutter's `cleanup` module.
* A bit of `setup.py` cleanup, thanks to `@oubiga`_.
* Now depends on binaryornot 0.2.0.

.. _`@sloria`: https://github.com/sloria/

0.6.2 (2013-08-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Depend on Jinja2>=2.4 instead of Jinja2==2.7.
* Fix errors on attempt to render binary files. Copy them over from the project
  template without rendering.
* Fix Python 2.6/2.7 `UnicodeDecodeError` when values containing Unicode chars
  are in `cookiecutter.json`.
* Set encoding in Python 3 `unicode_open()` to always be utf-8.

0.6.1 (2013-08-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Improved project template finding. Now looks for the occurrence of `{{`,
  `cookiecutter`, and `}}` in a directory name.
* Fix help message for input_dir arg at command prompt.
* Minor edge cases found and corrected, as a result of improved test coverage.

0.6.0 (2013-08-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Config is now in a single `cookiecutter.json` instead of in `json/`.
* When you create a project from a git repo template, Cookiecutter prompts
  you to enter custom values for the fields defined in `cookiecutter.json`.

0.5 (2013-07-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Friendlier, more simplified command line usage::

    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
    $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/
    
    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git

* Can now use Cookiecutter from Python as a package::

    from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter
    
    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
    cookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')

    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
    cookiecutter('https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git')

* Internal refactor to remove any code that changes the working directory.

0.4 (2013-07-22)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Only takes in one argument now: the input directory. The output directory
  is generated by rendering the name of the input directory.
* Output directory cannot be the same as input directory.

0.3 (2013-07-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Takes in command line args for the input and output directories.

0.2.1 (2013-07-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Minor cleanup.

0.2 (2013-07-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bumped to "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha".
